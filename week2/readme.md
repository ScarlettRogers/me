TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
a = 1
b = a+5
b = 6

apple = 11
banana = 5
apple == banana (double equals -> is apple equal to banana?) 
apple >= banana (true)
apple <= banana (false)

Collections
buckets of stuff

Flow control
deciding if you want to do something or not

Iterations
Lots of things

Values
Integers = counting numbers (0, 5, -4, 1000) --> count
Float = real number (0.5, -7.8, 15.0598) --> measure (continuous values, volume, etc)
Boolean = true/false --> yes or no question
String = Text/things to be treated as text ("hello world", "dave450")

>>> (means typing stuff on right hand side in an interactive session, when
you press enter something happens)

Variables
Expressions ("do something, and it does it"?)
Functions


Collections

Tuple 
Same as list
They go in round brackets
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
("I'm", "a", "mixed", "4", "5", "23", "list")

Dictionaries
In curly braces
{"name": "Cake", "taste": "Delicious"}

List
square brackets
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Flow Control


a=70
b=24
if a>b:
	print "hey there"
else:
	print "nope"

elif????

For each

Maps
It will apply the function to every elemenet in the list 


def add_1(a_number):
add_1 = technically a variable, but a function in this context

always return given values
